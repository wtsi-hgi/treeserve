To Do

Ideas for code improvements / enhancements

* add subtract method for IndexedMap to aid in calculating the *.* child attributes if required

* add an 'attributes' parameter to the api to allow choosing one or more seperate attributes to send out (including path as that has to be there) instead of the whole lot.

* put api information in bin/index.html to make it "self-documenting"

* add file suffix handling to get breakdown by various files (bam, cram etc.)

* go through the code looking for places where I should add const's

* write a buffered writer so that it can chunk up the json instead of creating the big string and sending the whole lot out.

* replace the recursive toJSON functions with non-recursive functions that manage their own stack to avoid kernel stack overflows and having to use ulimt -s

* make the code more robust - more error checking etc. Probably won't add exceptions as they hurt performance which is critical in this app.

* "pointers are evil" look into replacing the Datum* with Datum and using references.

* take the webserver code out the main program and wrap it in a class

* look into adding a lustre log listener thread which can modify the tree as live filesystem changes come through. That will free us from having to regenerate a static tree each day.
